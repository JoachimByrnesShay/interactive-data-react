### Project

An REACT based interactive comparison of world currency values, generating barcharts with data taken from 'https://openexchangerates.org/'
Charts display proportional values from perspective of, upon exchange, how many currency units of a comparison currency one gets in return for 1 unit of base currency, i.e., if user exchanges 1 dollar for comparison currency, how many units of comparison currency does user get.  Deliberatey, no react components were used in this version of the project.
